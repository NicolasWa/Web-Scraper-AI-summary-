# Web scraper (with AI summary completion)
Small pet project to scrape the web:
- Website scraped: Nature (2020 articles) https://www.nature.com/nature/articles?sort=PubDate&year=2020
- Scraping: retrieving of the articles' teasers, saving their content in files and (optional) write AI generated summaries using the davinci-003 model from OpenAI.

Note(s):
- Initially, the content of the article was retrieved. However, Nature recently changed a bit its website, with restricted access to contents (paywall). Now the scraper retrieves the article's teaser (when provided).
